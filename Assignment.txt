Machine Learning is a field of study where we teach a computer to complete a particular task without explicitely programming it.

Example: In the game of chess, the AI learns from it's experience of playing chess with other players and 
after each game it gains experience from the game and performs well in it's next game, so the probability of winning the game
increases after each game it plays. This happens without explicitely programming it to win the game.
